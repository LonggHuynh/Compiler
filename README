You need to first install haskell,
then go to the directory \src\main\resources\Sprockell\sprockell and run "cabal v1-install".



To compile the program, you need to use the complier method namely buildandRun, which
takes the program directory as the first argument and the name of sprockell file
that you want to output, then the sprockell file will be available at src/main/resources/Sprockell/sprockell/src/
There is an example in the main method of class Compiler
